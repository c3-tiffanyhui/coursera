        The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl.
        It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of more than 19 billion as
        of 2011.
        There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl. Humans keep chickens primarily as
        a
        source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for
        cockfighting or
        for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).

        <div class='menu-card-title menu-card-title-2'>Pork</div>
        Pork is the culinary name for meat from a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus).
        It is the most commonly consumed meat worldwide, with evidence of pig husbandry dating back to 5000 BC.
        Pork is eaten both freshly cooked and preserved. Curing extends the shelf life of the pork products.
        Ham, smoked pork, gammon, bacon and sausage are examples of preserved pork. Charcuterie is the branch of
        cooking devoted to prepared meat products, many from pork. Pork is the most popular meat in Eastern and
        Southeastern Asia, and is also very common in the Western world, especially in Central Europe.

        <div class='menu-card-title menu-card-title-3'>Beef</div>
        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef
        since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.
        Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide,
        after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the
        People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest
        beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil.
